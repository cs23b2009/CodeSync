# CodeSync Pro

> **The Ultimate Developer Growth Ecosystem: Compete. Build. Connect.**

CodeSync Pro is not just for competitive programmers—it is a 360-degree developer ecosystem designed to accelerate your career growth. We bring together three distinct worlds into one powerful platform:

1.  **COMPETE:** Master algorithm skills with unified contest tracking.
2.  **BUILD:** Innovate and create by discovering global hackathons.
3.  **CONNECT:** Grow your network by finding and following peers.

**The Real-World Problem We Solve:**
Developers currently fragment their growth journey across dozens of isolated tabs—checking three different sites for contests, scrolling generic event lists for hackathons, and struggling to find peers on LeetCode. **CodeSync Pro unifies this entire ecosystem into a single, high-performance command center.**

## 🚀 Three Pillars of Excellence

### ⚔️ Pillar 1: COMPETE (Contest Intelligence)
Dominate the leaderboards by never missing a match.
-   **Unified Dashboard:** Synchronized schedules from **LeetCode, Codeforces, and CodeChef**.
-   **Smart Editorials:** Automatic mapping of past contests to their **video solutions** for instant learning.
-   **Performance Tracking:** Visualize your rating history and contest consistency across all platforms.

### 🌟 Pillar 2: BUILD (Hackathon Explorer)
Stop solving imaginary problems. Start building real solutions.
-   **Global Innovation Calendar:** Real-time aggregation of hackathons from around the world.
-   **Mode Filters:** Easily find **Online** (remote-friendly) or **Offline** (local) events.
-   **Featured Spotlights:** Curated list of high-value innovation challenges.

### 🤝 Pillar 3: CONNECT (Social Graph)
You are the average of the five people you code with.
-   **LeetCode Buddy Search:** A specialized search engine to find and follow friends on LeetCode.
-   **Deep Search Technology:** Intelligent fallback to a seeded database of **16,000+ users** ensures you find profiles even when APIs are strict.
-   **Peer Analytics:** View comparative stats and progress of your peers.

### 💎 Pillar 4: SHOWCASE (Portfolio Tracker)
Your hard work deserves to be seen.
-   **Cross-Platform Portfolio:** A single view combining **LeetCode, CodeForces, and CodeChef** stats.
-   **Unified Heatmap:** A GitHub-style activity graph that merges your daily submissions from all three platforms into one "Green Wall".
-   **Instant Developer Card:** Generate a premium, sharable image card of your year's achievements with one click.
-   **Visual Weakness Analysis:** Donut charts and trend lines to identify your strongest and weakest topics.
